# 2025 Update: please use the new project `medium-to-jekyll-starter.github.io` instead.

I have integrated the latest version (v7.x) of Jekyll (Chirpy Theme) with my ZMediumToMarkdown Medium article download and conversion tool to create a new GitHub template repository: [medium-to-jekyll-starter.github.io](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/medium-to-jekyll-starter.github.io).

This tool can help you move your Medium posts to a Jekyll blog and keep them in sync in the future.

**One-time setting, Lifetime enjoying❤️**

It will automatically download your posts from Medium, convert them to Markdown, and upload them to your repository, check out [my blog](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/zhgchgli.github.io/) for online demo [zhgchg.li](https://zhgchg.li).

Powered by [ZMediumToMarkdown](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZMediumToMarkdown).

If you only want to create a backup or auto-sync of your Medium posts, you can use the GitHub Action directly by following the instructions in this [Wiki](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZMediumToMarkdown/wiki/How-to-use-Github-Action-as-your-free-&-no-code-Medium-Posts-backup-service).

## Setup

- You can follow along with each step of this process by watching the following [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsnZKFL3vks)

1. Click the green button `Use this template` located above and select `Create a new repository`.
2. Repo Owner could be an organization or username
2. Enter the **Repository Name**, which usually uses your **GitHub Username/Organization Name** and ends with `.github.io`, for example, my organization name is `zhgchgli` than it'll be `zhgchgli.github.io`.
3. Select the `public` repository option, and then click on `Create repository from template`.
4. Grant access to GitHub Actions by going to the `Settings` tab in your GitHub repository, selecting `Actions` -> `General`, and finding the `Workflow permissions section`, then, select `Read and write permissions`, and click on `Save` to save the changes.

*If you choose a different Repository Name, the GitHub page will be `https://username.github.io/Repository Name` instead of `https://username.github.io/`, and you will need to fill in the `baseurl` field in `_config.yml` with your Repository Name.

*If you are using an organization and cannot enable `Read and Write permissions` in the repository settings, please refer to the organization settings page and enable it there.

2. ⌛️ Please wait for the `Automatic Build` and `pages-build-deployment` gitHub actions to finish before making any further changes.
3. Then, you can manually run the ZMediumToMarkdown GitHub action by going to the `Actions` tab in your GitHub repository, selecting the `ZMediumToMarkdown` action, clicking on the `Run workflow` button, and selecting the `main` branch.
4. ⌛️ Please wait for the action to download and convert all Medium posts from the specified username, and commit the posts to your repository.
5. ⌛️ Please wait for the `Automatic Build` and `pages-build-deployment` actions will also need to finish before making any further changes, and that they will start automatically once the ZMediumToMarkdown action has completed.
6. Go to the `Settings` section of your GitHub repository and select `Pages`, In the `Branch` field, select `gh-pages`, and leave `/(root)` selected as the default. Click `Save`, you can also find the URL for your GitHub page at the top of the page.

8.  🎉 After all actions are completed, you can visit your xxx.github.io page to verify that the results are correct. Congratulations! 🎉

*To avoid expected Git conflicts or unexpected errors, please follow the steps carefully and in order, and be patient while waiting for each action to complete. 

*Note that the first time running may take longer.

*If you open the URL and notice that something is wrong, such as the web style being missing, please ensure that your configuration in the `_config.yml` file is correct.

### My GitHub page keeps presenting a 404 error or doesn't update with the latest posts.
- Please make sure you have followed the setup steps above in order.
- Wait for all GitHub actions to finish, including the `Pages build and deployment` and `Automatic Build` actions, you can check the progress on the `Actions` tab.
- Make sure you have the correct settings selected in `Settings -> Pages`.

## Things to know
- The `ZMediumToMarkdown` GitHub Action for syncing Medium posts will automatically run every day by default, and you can also manually trigger it on the GitHub Actions page or adjust the sync frequency as needed.
- **Every commit and post change will trigger the `Automatic Build` & `Pages build and deployment` action. Please wait for this action to finish before checking the final result.**
- You can create your own Markdown posts in the `_posts` directory by naming the file as `YYYY-MM-DD-POSTNAME` and recommend using lowercase file names.
- You can include images and other resources in the `/assets` directory.
- Also, if you would like to remove the ZMediumToMarkdown watermark located at the bottom of the post, you may do so. I don't mind.
- You can edit the Ruby file at `tools/optimize_markdown.rb` and uncomment lines `10-12`. This will automatically remove the ZMediumToMarkdown watermark at the end of all posts during Jekyll build time.
- Since ZMediumToMarkdown is not an official tool and Medium does not provide a public API for it, I cannot guarantee that the parser target will not change in the future. However, I have tried to test it for as many cases as possible. If you encounter any rendering errors or Jekyll build errors, please feel free to create an issue and I will fix them as soon as possible.
